### Bug Fixes

* **default export, tests, stories:** lots of tests in here, the big change though is the default export is fixed... probably should have checked that before publish... ([c45fa81](https://github.com/parkerself22/mui-table/commit/c45fa81))
* **test utils:** needed to call afterAll(sandbox.restore) for anywhere sinon was stubbing out functions. Caused an error in CI that was not thrown when running each test file individually. ([4e2874a](https://github.com/parkerself22/mui-table/commit/4e2874a))
